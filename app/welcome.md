### COVID-19 Risk Assessment Tool - Cordoba																

**Overview**: This risk assessment tool enables local authorities, leaders and policy-makers of urban environments to review the factors associated with increased risk of COVID-19 transmission and mortality in different neighborhoods of a large city, as well as assess the implementation of public health measures to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. There are 62 items, divided into three tabs: "Context" to describe the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the neighborhood; 2. "Epidemiology" to describe the current epidemiological situation related to COVID-19 in the neighborhood; and "Mitigation measures" to describe available healthcare services and public health measures in place. The items are further divided according to whether they measure risk of increased  COVID-19 transmission or mortality. Weights are distributed so that items associated with greater mortality are prioritized. Once all values are entered, the tool automatically calculates two composite scores: one for risk of transmission and mortality, and one for the effectiveness of current public health measures. Together, these scores classify the neighborhood to be of "low", "moderate", "high" or "very high" priority for COVID-19 response operations within the city. Neighborhoods that score "high" or "very high" should be prioritized for additional resources. 

This tool satisfies recommendation #3 from the WHO document "*Strengthening Preparedness for COVID-19 in Cities and Urban Settings: Interim Guidance for Local Authorities*", published on 28 April 2020 (available at: https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/331896). This recommendation states: "Identify existing hazards and vulnerabilities that could emerge as concurrent health emergencies that may need to be managed alongside COVID-19. This includes the use of local risk assessments, profiles and mapping based on epidemiological risk, and the anticipated risks that may emerge from the implementation of public health measures." Finally, the tool uses the 2012 WHO document "*Rapid Risk Assessment of Acute Public Health Events*" for its initial development (available at: https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/70810/WHO_HSE_GAR_ARO_2012.1_eng.pdf;jsessionid=6292CDAA788928BBD2D74005CC88C294?sequence=1).
